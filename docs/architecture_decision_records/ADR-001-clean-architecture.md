# ADR-001: Adopt Clean Architecture for jtext System

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The jtext system is a complex Japanese text processing application that requires:

- High maintainability and testability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy integration with external services (OCR, LLM, etc.)
- Support for multiple document types and processing modes
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

The current codebase has grown organically and lacks clear architectural boundaries, making it difficult to:

- Test individual components in isolation
- Replace external dependencies
- Add new features without affecting existing code
- Maintain consistent error handling across the system

## Decision

We will adopt Clean Architecture (Robert C. Martin) as the primary architectural pattern for the jtext system.

### Architecture Layers

1. **Domain Layer** (Innermost)

   - Entities: Document, ProcessingResult, OCRResult, etc.
   - Value Objects: DocumentId, Confidence, ProcessingMetrics, etc.
   - Domain Services: DocumentProcessingService, OCRService, etc.
   - Repository Interfaces: DocumentRepository, ProcessingResultRepository, etc.
   - Domain Events: DocumentProcessedEvent, ProcessingFailedEvent, etc.

2. **Application Layer**

   - Use Cases: ProcessDocumentUseCase, ProcessImageUseCase, etc.
   - DTOs: ProcessDocumentRequest, ProcessDocumentResponse, etc.
   - Application Services: DocumentProcessingApplicationService, etc.
   - Ports: DocumentProcessingPort, StatisticsPort, etc.

3. **Infrastructure Layer** (Outermost)
   - Repository Implementations: InMemoryDocumentRepository, etc.
   - External Service Adapters: TesseractOCRService, OllamaCorrectionService, etc.
   - Framework Adapters: ClickCLIAdapter, etc.
   - Cross-cutting Concerns: Logging, Error Handling, etc.

### Dependency Rule

- Dependencies point inward only
- Domain layer has no dependencies
- Application layer depends only on Domain layer
- Infrastructure layer depends on both Application and Domain layers

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested in isolation using mocks and stubs
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to understand and modify
- **Flexibility**: External dependencies can be easily swapped without affecting business logic
- **Independence**: Business logic is independent of frameworks, databases, and external services
- **Scalability**: New features can be added without affecting existing functionality

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Initial setup requires more boilerplate code
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand Clean Architecture principles
- **Over-engineering Risk**: May be overkill for simple features
- **Performance**: Additional abstraction layers may introduce slight performance overhead

### Mitigation Strategies

- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples
- Use dependency injection to manage complexity
- Implement comprehensive testing to catch issues early
- Monitor performance and optimize where necessary

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Domain Layer (Week 1)

- [x] Create domain entities and value objects
- [x] Define repository interfaces
- [x] Implement domain services
- [x] Create domain events

### Phase 2: Application Layer (Week 2)

- [x] Implement use cases
- [x] Create DTOs and application services
- [x] Define port interfaces

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Layer (Week 3)

- [x] Implement repository adapters
- [x] Create external service adapters
- [x] Implement cross-cutting concerns
- [x] Create framework adapters

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Week 4)

- [ ] Integrate all layers
- [ ] Implement comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
- [ ] Documentation and training
